# Learning Spring 3.0 with Kotlin, H2 Database, and JDBC

Welcome to the repository for learning Spring 3.0 with Kotlin, H2 Database, and JDBC! In this project, we will explore how to build a simple Spring application using Kotlin as the programming language, integrate an H2 Database for data storage, and interact with the database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer looking to expand your skills, this project will help you understand the fundamentals of these technologies.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) - Ensure you have Java 8 or higher installed.
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html) - Install the Kotlin programming language.
- [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) - Familiarize yourself with Spring and Spring Boot.
- [H2 Database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) - Install and configure the H2 Database.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - Version control system for managing your project.

## Project Setup

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/learning-spring-3.0-kotlin-h2-jdbc.git
```

## Creating a Spring Application

In this section, we will create a simple Spring application using Kotlin. We'll set up the project structure and configure the Spring environment.

## Integrating H2 Database

We will integrate the H2 Database into our Spring application. H2 is an in-memory database that is perfect for development and testing.

## Implementing JDBC

Learn how to implement JDBC to interact with the H2 Database. We'll create DAOs (Data Access Objects) and services to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.

## Running the Application

Instructions on how to run the Spring application and test the functionality will be provided in this section.
